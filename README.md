[Udacity] Nano degree Machine Learning Project: Explore Chicago Bikeshare Data

Because the chicago.csv file is too large, it's not possible include this on Github. However, the chicago - subset.csv is a subset of this file with the first 1000 lines and the chicago_bikeshare - subset 1000.py read this file with the same code of the chicago_bikeshare.py.
